## Biscuit's Lethal Company Modpack

> Mods that add just enough, but not too much.

This is a modpack for Lethal Company made for myself and my friends to play. The modpack adds popular mods as well as
mods chosen from our own tastes. The goal of the modpack is to make the game more fun and interesting by adding cool
game mechanics and other quality of life changes without either completely breaking the game's immersion or adding
unfair "cheese".

Currently, the modpack is compatible with Lethal Company `v66` and
requires [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx).

### Installation

Backup and delete the existing contents of the `BepInEx` folder located in your Lethal Company installation. Keep
the `core` folder and drop in the contents from this repository.

### Mod List

Below is a table containing every mod, version, and a link to install any mod yourself.
